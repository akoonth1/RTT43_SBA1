### Project Description

SBA_1v1 is a web application that recreates the functionality of a Pok-Nav tool found in the original first 2 generations of games from the Pokemon franchise. This includes tools such as a Pokedex, town map, radio, and a few other features to help with your Pokemon Journey across Kanto. The site is designed with a user-friendly interface and should scale based on screen-size.
